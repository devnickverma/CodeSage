Overview
As a Full-Stack Developer Intern, your objective is to design and implement a Task
Management, a web application that enables users to manage tasks. This task is expected to
be completed within 2 days, demonstrating your ability to develop both frontend and backend
components efficiently while following best practices.
Key Features
1. Task Management :
○ Task Management: Implement functionality to create, edit, delete, and mark
tasks as completed.
2. Backend API Development:
○ Tech Stack: Utilize Node.js with Express or any other backend framework of
your choice.
○ API Endpoints:
■ GET /tasks: Retrieve all tasks.
■ POST /tasks: Create a new task.
■ PUT /tasks/:id: Update an existing task (e.g., mark as completed or
modify details).
■ DELETE /tasks/:id: Remove a task.
○ Error Handling: Implement proper HTTP status codes and messages for
common issues (e.g., validation failures, missing resources).
3. Data Persistence:
○ Storage Options: Choose an appropriate data storage mechanism, such as an
in-memory store, file-based JSON storage, SQLite, or another database.
Data Model Details
Below is a suggested schema for task and activity management:
● Task Model:
○ id: Unique identifier (string or number).
○ title: Brief description of the task.
○ description: (Optional) Detailed information about the task.
○ completed: Boolean flag indicating task status.
Implementation Guidelines
● Frontend Development: You have full flexibility in designing the UI using any frontend
framework (React/ Next js). The focus should be on functionality, not aesthetics.
● Code Quality: Follow best practices for modularity, readability, and maintainability.
Ensure adequate documentation within your code.
● API Documentation: Include a README file detailing:
○ Installation steps and setup instructions.
○ API endpoints with request/response formats.
○ Instructions for testing the API using Postman, curl, or any other tool.
○ Screenshots showcasing the UI.
This assignment serves as a practical demonstration of your full-stack development capabilities,
problem-solving skills, and ability to implement a structured and efficient solution. Focus on
delivering a functional, well-documented, and maintainable application within the given
timeframe.
